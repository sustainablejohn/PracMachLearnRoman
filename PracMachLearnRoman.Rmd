## Practical Machine Learning

```{r }
trainingDownload <- download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv", "/home/susty/R/R projects/PracMachLearnRoman/training.csv")
testingDownload <- download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv", "/home/susty/R/R projects/PracMachLearnRoman/testing.csv")
training <- read.csv("training.csv")
testing <- read.csv("testing.csv")
preTrain <- preProcess(training[,-160], method= c("center", "scale"))
```
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
